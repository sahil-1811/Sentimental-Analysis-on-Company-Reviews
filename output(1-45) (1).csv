That being said, I work there as a contractor, and the above statement was made from the outside looking in. Contractors are included in day-to-day functions just as a permanent employee; in fact one can forget that it's ""contract work"". There's no cultural difference, contractors and FTEs (full time employees) co-mingle, and work on the same teams. The split becomes apparent when it comes to benefits, and some positions/job tasks are only available to FTEs.I'm at the end of my 3-year contract and didn't get hired permentently. We were told that COVID changed how many FTEs they can support, and I completely understand. However, that brings me to the 'con': like all companies, there are some who 'work the system' and/or produce substandard work. The trouble is some of those people are FTEs and it actually seems hard to get fired once you're 'in'. This leads to no open positions for good contractors who have met/exceeded metrics and a have professional moral compass that points due north.There's also a dichotomy there - Genentech tends to regularly 'fix what's not broken', constantly upgrading and updating, making small changes to procedures, etc; yet when it comes to big issues such as their training program, or keeping people accountable when caught 'cherrypicking' easy work or resetting their place in the phone queue, there's an almost staunch refusal to improve.On the technical side, their system of record is ridiculously over-engineered,"," March 15, 2022"," Portland, OR "

CEO and other C-Suite were active in weekly All-Hands meetings and were open about progress, failures, opportunities. They made good-faith efforts to engage the team with QA and try to address both tough and frivolous issues directly. This was facilitated by the company being as small as it was, but the best thing about working at Reddit is that you could tell the people working there gave a d*mn.  Even if there were so many challenges there was also so much room to grow and improve. The flip side to that coin was that (when I was there) Reddit was struggling to be a well organized, professional company- things were always changing, turnover and burnout at all levels, and people's experience at Reddit was either pretty good/ok structurally or absolutely terrible. 95% of this depended on your manager, their manager, and your team. Certain teams absolutely had it together. They had the talent, tools, and support they needed to do their best work. Other teams were in absolute shambles spending more time trying to source the talent, build the tools, and try to find the support they needed than actually doing their jobs, by no fault of their own.

Some of the coupon lady love me which made my day.Scheduling was a nightmare, its change constantly which I kinda expected from a retail.Management need a major improvement. They only care about fellow management team member. Since I was just a cashier there, I'm pretty much a punching bag for them. When something happen, it doesn't affect the management team, but the cashier take a huge hit. My hour was cut, got put a shift that no one want to work. One day an associate from other store didn't have enough hours so my manager from my store cut my hours and gave it to him without discuss anything to me or say anything.One time a shift manager take 4 days off, but didn't make it official to the store, She just show up and switching my scheduling and other cashier scheduling without even asking our permission.

Our trainer had been reading off power points the entirety of the two weeks of training we had. No hands on, no practice. Power points.

We got some extra days of training where we actually got to train in our practice work environment. But to no avail, everyone was still anxious.

Unfortunately the schedules were made on a weekly basis, which means it was very hard to plan ahead of things around your schedule, especially for this being a starter job while I was in high school. Another issue is that the schedules were never consistent, and so the days that you'd be working were different each week, and sometimes could possibly change randomly without being given any notification. This led to me having to call off various times and overall just made it very hard to manage attendance.  A typical day of work however, was pretty straightforward. Simply just went to the cash register, cleaned it, and got it ready for customers.One major benefit of Giant Eagle is they are part of the Western Union, which means everyone gets a significant amount of breaks and you are allowed to rest when needed. A major con of that however is that you do have to pay union fees which come out of your paycheck.Finally, the most enjoyable parts of the job were definitely just talking with my co-workers. They were quite fun to talk with and overall I got along with them well.

Not a place for new or inexperienced nurses.  Never get breaks, patient to staff ratio is too high for the acuity of the patients. Expect you to work overtime all the time due to staffing shortages.
